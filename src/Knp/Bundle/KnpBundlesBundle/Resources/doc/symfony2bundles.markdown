If you've been using Symfony2 for some time, you probably knew Symfony2bundles.  
We've launched this service back in June 2010 to list all **Symfony2 bundles** - yes, hence the name.

We've changed its name to comply with the Symfony trademark policy.

**Symfony2bundles is now [KnpBundles](http://bundles.knplabs.org)!**

More [details about Symfony2bundles](http://knplabs.fr/blog/symfony2bundles-becomes-knpbundle) are availables on knplabs.com.
